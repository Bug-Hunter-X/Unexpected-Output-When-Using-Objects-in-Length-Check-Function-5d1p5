This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling different input types when calculating length. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises when an object (without a length property) is passed to the function designed to check length, resulting in an unexpected `undefined` output instead of a more graceful handling of this scenario. The solution addresses this by explicitly checking for the existence of the `length` property before accessing it.
